Purpose:
	To help me document my Programs that I right.
	Is meant to break up my code into sections where I can view the code Structure in English

Objectives:
	Must display Options based on a number or letter each a new line

	ask for a input and then use it too display new words 

	ask for an input again to show sudo code based in selection
	
	Perhaps I will be able to add a section where I can create documentation based on user input in the future
	
	Perhaps I can create my own programming language too do this where I take the input of text which I can use special syntax for
	
	Then I can add special cases for when the Code is being parsed to trigger other functions that will change the text in a certain way
