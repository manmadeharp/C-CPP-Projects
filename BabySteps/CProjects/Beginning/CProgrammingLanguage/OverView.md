# How I'm going to tackle this book
### It's all about the excercises
- First it's about doing the excercise to improve problem solving skills. 

- Use the reference at the back of the book to help.

### Comprehension
- it's about writing notes on each chapter then thinking about how it can be used and using it.

- It was a bad idea to think I could just do 50 pages a day and be able to program in C after that.

- instead I should focus on doing 2 hours of the book a day and then 1 hour after coding from what I know.

- Use Ideas as a springboard for new projects.
