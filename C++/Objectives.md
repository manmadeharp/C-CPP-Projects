# Current Objectives in C++
### Maths Graphics and Computer Vision
- Develop Mathematics Library: Mechanics Pure mathematics (Algebra, Calculus...)
- Create visual simulations with SFML (Physics)
- After some time with SFML start using OpenGL and OpenCV
- Create graphics representations in OpenGL of pictures analysed with OpenCV
- 

### Now move focus on too AI
- Develop Statistics Library
- Integrate C++ with Python
- Create Machine Learning Library: Backpropagation, Linear Regression...
- Develop Vision Recognition Systems with OpenCV and PyTorch
- Create Handwritten Document Recognition Software
