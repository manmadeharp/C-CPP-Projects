## Project Overview
##### Important Files
###### Calc.cpp
- This is the entry point to the program 
- It handles the user input and forms tokens from the istream.
- the tokens are the used to call other functions
###### ALvlMath Folder
- This will be where the algorithms I make for my A Level maths course will be placed
###### GUI Folder
- This is where I plan to use SFML as a UI for geometry and visualising mathematical concepts and such.
The Rest of the files and folders are either WIP or need to be removed.
