# Math Library
- starting With A level Mathematics.

### ALvlMath

> This Library is made up of OCR MEI A Level Mathematics

##### It Needs to be Able to:

- Be general enough to be used in SFML programs.

- Be general enough to use in calculator programs

> It is my first attempt at creating a library of code.



##### To Do
- Add new functions to mathlibrary and calculator

##### Done
- added function calling to calculator

##### Things I've Learnt
- I've learnt that C++ is non Reflective making it hard to program a interpreter/Compiler
- Perhaps I should think hard about how I can tackle a problem before tackling it. It could reduce the time it takes to solve the problem.
