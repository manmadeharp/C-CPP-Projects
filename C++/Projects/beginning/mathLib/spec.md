# Math Library
- starting With A level Mathematics.

### ALvlMath

> This Library is made up of OCR MEI A Level Mathematics

##### It Needs to be Able to:

- Be general enough to be used in SFML programs.

- Be general enough to use in calculator programs

> It is my first attempt at creating a library of code.



##### To Do
- Add new functions to mathlibrary and calculator.

##### Current Bugs
- Token does not reset after GUI is called.
###### Passing Variables as Functions
- determine if a letter passed as an argument, is a definede varible through a class function return boolean, checkToken.
- store a function containing a unknown varible as an argument until the variable is defined, then once the variable is defined print the functions output.

##### Done
- added function calling to calculator

##### Things I've Learnt
- I've learnt that C++ is non Reflective making it hard to program a interpreter/Compiler
- Perhaps I should think hard about how I can tackle a problem before tackling it. It could reduce the time it takes to solve the problem.
